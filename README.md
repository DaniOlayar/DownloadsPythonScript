# Folder Organizer

A simple file organizer which moves files from your Downloads folder to ohter folders, depending of the type of file.

## Description

Using python I am able to transfer most of my files to another folders. In my case I have another disk that I use to store documents, music, images, etc. My main drive doesn't have that much space because it's only for boot and some programs, and I don't have all the time of the world to do it manually.

Using Task Scheduler I can schedule it to run the script every day at the end of the day (at 11:59 PM).
